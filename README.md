# Web Engineering Teaching Journey

Welcome to my documentation of a volunteer teaching journey in Web Engineering! This repository is a living record of my day-to-day lessons, resources, and reflections as I guide learners through the fundamentals and advanced concepts of web development.

## About This Journey

Over the next 2-3 months (or longer), I will be teaching web engineering to a group of learners. Each day, I will document the lesson content, challenges, solutions, and additional resources. The aim is to create a transparent, reusable, and helpful resource for anyone interested in learning or teaching web engineering.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Day-wise Documentation:** Each teaching day has its own folder with a README detailing the lesson, key concepts, code samples, challenges, and solutions.
- **Resources:** Images, external links, and references to other files in this repository are included for a richer learning experience.
- **Open Source:** Feel free to use, adapt, or contribute to these materials!

## Repository Structure

```bash
├── index.html                # Main HTML file (if used for demos)
├── README.md                 # Root documentation (this file)
├── day-01/                   # Day 01 lesson folder
│   └── README.md             # Day 01 lesson details
├── day-02/                   # Day 02 lesson folder (to be added)
│   └── README.md             # Day 02 lesson details (to be added)
... (and so on for each day)
```
